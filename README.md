# genpygoodies

genpygoodies is an extra library for the [generativepy project](https://github.com/martinmcbride/generativepy).

It contains an assortment of extras that I find useful while working with generativepy, but aren't suitable for inclusion in the main generativepy project, because they are very specialised, or incomplete, or just too random to fit in there.

Still if they are useful to me there is a chance that they might be useful to other people. Also, even if the code here doesn't do exactly what you want, it might give you a starting point to develop your own collection of goodies.

If you have anything that you think might be useful to other people, feel free to submit a PR.
