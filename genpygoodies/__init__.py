"""
`genpygoodies` is a ragtag library of extra classes and functions that I find useful when I am using the `generativepy` library.

It is a fairly random collection of different types of functionality, and doesn't claim to be complete. In most cases the implementations here aren't quite as
general purpose as the classes supplied with the main generativepy library. They are mainly small classes that do a simple job without too many bells and whistles.

However I use all the things here, and most of it has unit tests, so it mainly works reasonably reliably.

Most of the items here are fairly simple, so if they do not do exactly what you need they might still serve as a starting point for your own code

The modules are:

* `diagrams` - contains various subpackages for drawing different types of diagrams.
* `diagrams.graph` - draws graphs - networks of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or connections). Includes support for directed graphs, weighted graphs, and loops.
